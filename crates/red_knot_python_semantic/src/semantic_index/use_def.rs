//! Build a map from each use of a symbol to the definitions visible from that use.
//!
//! Let's take this code sample:
//!
//! ```python
//! x = 1
//! x = 2
//! y = x
//! if flag:
//!     x = 3
//! else:
//!     x = 4
//! z = x
//! ```
//!
//! In this snippet, we have four definitions of `x` (the statements assigning `1`, `2`, `3`,
//! and `4` to it), and two uses of `x` (the `y = x` and `z = x` assignments). The first
//! [`Definition`] of `x` is never visible to any use, because it's immediately replaced by the
//! second definition, before any use happens. (A linter could thus flag the statement `x = 1`
//! as likely superfluous.)
//!
//! The first use of `x` has one definition visible to it: the assignment `x = 2`.
//!
//! Things get a bit more complex when we have branches. We will definitely take either the `if` or
//! the `else` branch. Thus, the second use of `x` has two definitions visible to it: `x = 3` and
//! `x = 4`. The `x = 2` definition is no longer visible, because it must be replaced by either `x
//! = 3` or `x = 4`, no matter which branch was taken. We don't know which branch was taken, so we
//! must consider both definitions as visible, which means eventually we would (in type inference)
//! look at these two definitions and infer a type of `Literal[3, 4]` -- the union of `Literal[3]`
//! and `Literal[4]` -- for the second use of `x`.
//!
//! So that's one question our use-def map needs to answer: given a specific use of a symbol, which
//! definition(s) is/are visible from that use. In
//! [`AstIds`](crate::semantic_index::ast_ids::AstIds) we number all uses (that means a `Name` node
//! with `Load` context) so we have a `ScopedUseId` to efficiently represent each use.
//!
//! The other case we need to handle is when a symbol is referenced from a different scope (the
//! most obvious example of this is an import). We call this "public" use of a symbol. So the other
//! question we need to be able to answer is, what are the publicly-visible definitions of each
//! symbol?
//!
//! Technically, public use of a symbol could also occur from any point in control flow of the
//! scope where the symbol is defined (via inline imports and import cycles, in the case of an
//! import, or via a function call partway through the local scope that ends up using a symbol from
//! the scope via a global or nonlocal reference.) But modeling this fully accurately requires
//! whole-program analysis that isn't tractable for an efficient incremental compiler, since it
//! means a given symbol could have a different type every place it's referenced throughout the
//! program, depending on the shape of arbitrarily-sized call/import graphs. So we follow other
//! Python type-checkers in making the simplifying assumption that usually the scope will finish
//! execution before its symbols are made visible to other scopes; for instance, most imports will
//! import from a complete module, not a partially-executed module. (We may want to get a little
//! smarter than this in the future, in particular for closures, but for now this is where we
//! start.)
//!
//! So this means that the publicly-visible definitions of a symbol are the definitions still
//! visible at the end of the scope.
//!
//! The data structure we build to answer these two questions is the `UseDefMap`. It has a
//! `definitions_by_use` vector indexed by [`ScopedUseId`] and a `public_definitions` vector
//! indexed by [`ScopedSymbolId`]. The values in each of these vectors are (in principle) a list of
//! visible definitions at that use, or at the end of the scope for that symbol.
//!
//! In order to avoid vectors-of-vectors and all the allocations that would entail, we don't
//! actually store these "list of visible definitions" as a vector of [`Definition`] IDs. Instead,
//! the values in `definitions_by_use` and `public_definitions` are a [`Definitions`] struct that
//! keeps a [`Range`] into a third vector of [`Definition`] IDs, `all_definitions`. The trick with
//! this representation is that it requires that the definitions visible at any given use of a
//! symbol are stored sequentially in `all_definitions`.
//!
//! There is another special kind of possible "definition" for a symbol: it might be unbound in the
//! scope. (This isn't equivalent to "zero visible definitions", since we may go through an `if`
//! that has a definition for the symbol, leaving us with one visible definition, but still also
//! the "unbound" possibility, since we might not have taken the `if` branch.)
//!
//! The simplest way to model "unbound" would be as an actual [`Definition`] itself: the initial
//! visible [`Definition`] for each symbol in a scope. But actually modeling it this way would
//! dramatically increase the number of [`Definition`] that Salsa must track. Since "unbound" is a
//! special definition in that all symbols share it, and it doesn't have any additional per-symbol
//! state, we can represent it more efficiently: we use the `may_be_unbound` boolean on the
//! [`Definitions`] struct. If this flag is `true`, it means the symbol/use really has one
//! additional visible "definition", which is the unbound state. If this flag is `false`, it means
//! we've eliminated the possibility of unbound: every path we've followed includes a definition
//! for this symbol.
//!
//! To build a [`UseDefMap`], the [`UseDefMapBuilder`] is notified of each new use and definition
//! as they are encountered by the
//! [`SemanticIndexBuilder`](crate::semantic_index::builder::SemanticIndexBuilder) AST visit. For
//! each symbol, the builder tracks the currently-visible definitions for that symbol. When we hit
//! a use of a symbol, it records the currently-visible definitions for that symbol as the visible
//! definitions for that use. When we reach the end of the scope, it records the currently-visible
//! definitions for each symbol as the public definitions of that symbol.
//!
//! Let's walk through the above example. Initially we record for `x` that it has no visible
//! definitions, and may be unbound. When we see `x = 1`, we record that as the sole visible
//! definition of `x`, and flip `may_be_unbound` to `false`. Then we see `x = 2`, and it replaces
//! `x = 1` as the sole visible definition of `x`. When we get to `y = x`, we record that the
//! visible definitions for that use of `x` are just the `x = 2` definition.
//!
//! Then we hit the `if` branch. We visit the `test` node (`flag` in this case), since that will
//! happen regardless. Then we take a pre-branch snapshot of the currently visible definitions for
//! all symbols, which we'll need later. Then we go ahead and visit the `if` body. When we see `x =
//! 3`, it replaces `x = 2` as the sole visible definition of `x`. At the end of the `if` body, we
//! take another snapshot of the currently-visible definitions; we'll call this the post-if-body
//! snapshot.
//!
//! Now we need to visit the `else` clause. The conditions when entering the `else` clause should
//! be the pre-if conditions; if we are entering the `else` clause, we know that the `if` test
//! failed and we didn't execute the `if` body. So we first reset the builder to the pre-if state,
//! using the snapshot we took previously (meaning we now have `x = 2` as the sole visible
//! definition for `x` again), then visit the `else` clause, where `x = 4` replaces `x = 2` as the
//! sole visible definition of `x`.
//!
//! Now we reach the end of the if/else, and want to visit the following code. The state here needs
//! to reflect that we might have gone through the `if` branch, or we might have gone through the
//! `else` branch, and we don't know which. So we need to "merge" our current builder state
//! (reflecting the end-of-else state, with `x = 4` as the only visible definition) with our
//! post-if-body snapshot (which has `x = 3` as the only visible definition). The result of this
//! merge is that we now have two visible definitions of `x`: `x = 3` and `x = 4`.
//!
//! The [`UseDefMapBuilder`] itself just exposes methods for taking a snapshot, resetting to a
//! snapshot, and merging a snapshot into the current state. The logic using these methods lives in
//! [`SemanticIndexBuilder`](crate::semantic_index::builder::SemanticIndexBuilder), e.g. where it
//! visits a `StmtIf` node.
//!
//! (In the future we may have some other questions we want to answer as well, such as "is this
//! definition used?", which will require tracking a bit more info in our map, e.g. a "used" bit
//! for each [`Definition`] which is flipped to true when we record that definition for a use.)
